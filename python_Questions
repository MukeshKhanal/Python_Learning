""" 
Strings:
Given the string "hello world", write code to:

Print the first character of the string.
Print the last character of the string.
Print the string in uppercase.
Print the string in reverse order.
You have the string "python is awesome".

Replace the word "awesome" with "cool".
Split the string into a list of words.
Join the words back into a single string using a space as the separator.
Check if the string "apple" contains the letter 'p'. If it does, print "Found p!". Otherwise, print "p not found."
"""




"""
Lists:
Given the list numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]:

Print the second and fourth elements of the list.
Add the number 30 to the end of the list.
Remove the number 10 from the list.
Find and print the length of the list.
Given the list of strings: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]:

Print the first three fruits in the list.
Check if "banana" is in the list. If it is, print "Banana is in the list."
Sort the list in reverse alphabetical order.
For Loops:
Write a for loop to iterate through the list fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] and print each fruit in uppercase.

Write a for loop that prints all even numbers from 0 to 20.

Given a list of numbers numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], use a for loop to:

Multiply each number by 2 and print the result.
Create a for loop to print the index and value of each element in the list fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].
"""
# If-Else Statements:
# Write an if-else statement to check if the number 12 is greater than 10. If it is, print "12 is greater than 10". Otherwise, print "12 is not greater than 10."

# Given the list numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], write an if-else statement that:

# Prints "The list has an even number of elements" if the list has an even number of elements.
# Prints "The list has an odd number of elements" if the list has an odd number of elements.
# Check if a given number num = 25 is divisible by both 5 and 10. If it is, print "Divisible by both". Otherwise, print "Not divisible by both".

# Write an if statement that checks if a given number n = 8 is positive, negative, or zero. Print an appropriate message for each case.

# Combined Practice (Strings, Lists, For Loops, and If-Else):
# Given the list words = ["hello", "world", "python", "is", "awesome"], write a for loop that:

# Prints the word and its length.
# If the word length is greater than 4, print "Long word", otherwise print "Short word".
# Write code to count how many times the letter 'o' appears in the string "hello world" and print the result.
